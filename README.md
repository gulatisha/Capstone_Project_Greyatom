## Capstone_Project_Greyatom
Capstone Project on Mahindra First Choice Dataset focussed on solving following problems:

### Geological Based Customer Analysis
1. Identifying the ownership pattern of cars throughout the country. This also captures the
problem wherein information regarding the spending patterns can be identified.

Approach:
- Which areas have most cars?
- Which make/car is more popular?
- What is service structure for particular make/car?
- Which type of service is popular in a certain area i.e. repairs or maintenance?

2. Identify the type of order each state receives and present it as an interactive visualization.

Approach:
- What are the different types of services provided? 
- What is the difference in each service/labour costing?
- Is the service seasonal or regular?
- Is the service mandatory or not?
- Which service is popular regarding a certain make/car?


### Market Segmentation
1. Customer Lifetime Value Prediction – Based on Customer Segments , predict the revenue
that can be extracted from each segment over a life of a car – Regression / Time Series.

Approach:
- Based on customer segments, we can predict how much revenue can be generated from a group. 
- What services will a particular group opt for?
- Which make/car is popular among a group/segment?


2. Marketing Recommendations

Approach:
- Which marketing source is responsible in bringing which type of customer? 
- Which marketing source brings the most business?
- What is the average income per source?
